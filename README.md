#1. Introduction:
 My name is Tri Thanh Nguyen; this is my first web project. The project focuses on making my portfolio in a web page format. The purpose of the project is to portrait my capabilities in front end development and market myself as a web developer. The focus is on introducing who am I, the works that I have done up until this day. 

#2. Thought process of building:
In every project, researching, planning is the vital step. My approach was to build up my inspiration through finding different web portfolio from experienced developers. I used Pinterest, keywords to search through google. So then I would create a wireframe to examine what the look of each section. Then, I decided on the contents that I can put in each section. Finally, I designed few different mockups and chose one that I felt most comfortable and begin my building. 

When it comes to formatting, I chose the simple, straightforward and bright theme path to convey my message to the viewers, but I also wanted to blend in some creativity and flashy features so I can keep viewers' attention. Also, I believe if I add in many effects/features I would not have enough room for adding/altering the contents and finish projects soon.  

#3. Preparation Process/Design and Approach: 
The initial plan was to learn HTML/CSS and finish the mockup by Friday, so I can start on building my website throughout the second week. 
In the first week, I spend the morning on researching for inspiration and building mockups, in the afternoon I would concentrate on learning HTML/CSS. I grasped the HTML/CSS concept pretty quick, as I have learned some HTML/CSS before the course through Freecodecamp. After I had got the concept and mockup ready, I began to work on HTML layout, such as elements, attributes, classes, id. However, as I did not have much time to learn about HTML/CSS I still have to do much researching on the fly. 
#4. Tool Used:
    Pen and paper
    Creative XD
    Pinterest
    Image Editor (online)
    Visual Studio Code
    Frameworks and libraries: Devicon, font-awesome, bootstrap

#5. Building Process: 
 1. Basic layout:
    First, I began to build HTML layout, then I add in content for each section, and then I started with CSS. However, I faced with difficulty while trying to make the website responsive after adding in image sliders. I decided that I would use bootstrap for its grid system and responsive feature. 
 2. Bootstrap
    Bootstrap has many features inbuilt as a framework that I believe would vastly reduce the development speed, which I need to use because I only have one week to build my website. Some of the features from bootstrap included: 
        Navbar& Dropdowns  - List groups - Wells & Panels - Form & Input - Thumbnails - Grid system - Tables - etc...
    Also, I used Navbar & Dropdowns, Grid System,  Form & Input, and Buttons & Link, the reason I used these were the belief of its responsiveness, and I would spend less time worrying about how each element coordinate with each other. 
 3. Style Guide: font, number of colors, line break (hr)
    I used the standard font for most of the titles, and Crimson-text font for the paragraph. My choice of colors was: white, black and orange (#ffa500). I did not want to cluster my contents with colors as most of my contents are temporary right now. I also used line break beneath each main title; I believe this would help to reduce the cluster from paragraphs. 
 4. Navigation Bar:
    As my portfolio has 5 section: landing page, about me, skills, portfolio, and contact. I made the navigation bar with my logo on the left, and I navigation buttons on the right. In my mobile screen size, the buttons would get hidden, and the menu dropdown box appears those I buttons. 
 5. Page content:
    About me's section is where I split introduction about me into three paragraphs, each address one question. Skills section I would discuss the tools that I have used and my scope for improving those skills. In the portfolio section, I would have all the projects I have done, including the web portfolio. 
    Contact section: I used the form & input and buttons from bootstrap to create the form for viewers to communicate with me by putting in their names, emails, and message. I also have three buttons for social links. 
#6.Challenges and difficulties: 
    1. Using purely html5/css (long time to figure out,)
    It was quite a challenging task to use strictly HTML/CSS, which was why I shifted towards adding in bootstrap. At first, I did not like the idea of using bootstrap, as I thought using HTML/CSS would be a great way to show that I have a strong understanding. However, after some research and learn about bootstrap, I realize that in the real world I need to produce the product as fast as possible, as long as it functionals and meet the standards. Moreover, I can also go back to improve the code if I need to in the future. Clients/Employers focus on minimizing resources and time as the priority, and there is no real incentive to use HTML/CSS if it takes much longer time. I come to the theory that as craftsmen(developer) I need to be able to use hand tool (HTML/CSS) and combine with the power tool (frameworks) to produce the best possible product in a set timeframe.
    2. Adding functionality: 
    The functionality and features that I currently have for my web portfolio is image slider from bootstrap, and I did not use other javascript/jquery slider because I do not have enough knowledge to make it work as it should. I used HTML/CSS to make image-parallax(background fixed scrolling). By not using javascript, I thought that I would increase the performance in the future in case that I want to add more feature that could potentially affect the performance. Also, I have tried different methods with javascript, but the I could not get the result I was expecting. 
    3. Not enough contents to make web page looks professional (limited work experiences,)
    My other challenge is having sufficient materials so that the web page would look more professional, but I believe as in progressively improving the website every week, I can come up with some creative contents and format that I can replace the existing. 
#7. Summary
    Although the time I was given to build my web portfolio was quite short, I have learned a lot during the process; I grasped the basic concepts of using HTML/CSS along with some bootstrap. I learned the process of building a website could get very complex as I am expanding on it. Moreover, there are many more things that I can learn from working on my project. I also realize to master HTML or CSS alone can also take much time as it can be very challenging. However, I think that I have achieved the scope of the project which is to make the web page responsive to different viewing ports and maximize the viewer's readability. 

#8. Future development: adding functionality, remake contents, navigation bar, adding the new blog, and resume pop up. 
    As my web development continues, I would like to add more features to my site so that I can expand my knowledge on frontend development.
    Here are the features I wish to incorporate into my portfolio: 
    1. Rework the navigation bar to use only HTML/CSS and make it responsive.
    2. Adding banner/content with some fading animation into my carousel on the landing page, so that I can convey the message of who am I as a developer in few keywords.
    3. Rework the about me section, right now I feel like the message I try to convey is still quite long and cluster, I would love to break it down into sentences, to around 8 - 10 sentences with some icons and animation when scrolling through the section. 
    4. Rework the skills section, as I expand my knowledge into JavaScripts and other tools, I can change my skills section to describe my specialty best. 
    5. Progressively adding more contents into the portfolio, and adding some animation such as blackout/zoom in/display hidden text when hovering across each project. 
    6. The forms & input is displaying correctly, but the data input is not functional, so I'd to make it function as it should.
    7. Adding in a blogging page, and a navigation button to my personal blog. 
    8. Adding a feature for resume pop up, so that when users hover over designated area, it shows a link/button so that my resume would pop if clicked. 
    9. Host my web portfolio publicly.
